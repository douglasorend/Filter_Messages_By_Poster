## Introduction
This mod allows the user to restrict the displaying of messages by any poster by using the filter icon in the poster area in the messages display.  The filtering can be stopped using the unfilter icon in the poster area in the messages display (or using the back button, naturally).

## Admin Settings
There are no admin settings.  To disable it, you must remove this mod.

## Compatibility Notes
This mod was tested on SMF 2.0.15 and SMF 2.1 Beta 3, but should work on SMF 2.0 and up.  SMF 2.1 Beta 1, SMF 2.1 Beta 2, and SMF 1.x is not and will not be supported.
